### Hi there, I'm Jose Barahona ðŸ‘‹


I'm a seasoned IT enthusiast with over 10 years of experience diving into everything from traditional sysadmin tasks to the latest cloud technologies. Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working on a wide range of diverse projects, each presenting its own unique challenges and learning opportunities.

Currently, my focus revolves around cloud providers, where I spend most of my time harnessing the power of Terraform and Kubernetes clusters to manage workloads efficiently. On the side, I've been dabbling in coding, primarily using Go and Python for those everyday tasks that need a bit of automation magic.

Recently, I've been having a blast tinkering with my homelab setup. Thanks to a shiny new fiber connection at home, I've found myself diving into the world of IoT, NAS's, and experimenting with low-powered servers. It's been a fun and rewarding way to explore new technologies and bring my projects to life right from the comfort of my own home.


I do some community work as organizer in the local  CNCF chapter in my country [CNCF_San_salvador](https://community.cncf.io/san-salvador/)
